Imagine that the shape below is the outer casing of a mechanical part. We want to write a function that computes and returns the surface area and volume (in that order) of the object that has the four dimensions depicted in the figure: h, w, d and n. Complete the function part_info, which takes parameters h, w, d and n and which returns the two required, computed values. You do not need to worry about strange cases, like 2n > h, and the like.
Volumn=2nwd+2nhd+whd
Function Call	Expected Return Values
part_info(10, 14, 17, 1)	1328, 3196
part_info(21, 25, 17, 3)	3574, 13617
